    <h1>Hello and welcome to our study!</h1>

    First and foremost, we would like to thank you for taking part, your support for our study is greatly
    appreciated.<br><br>

    On the following pages, you will be confronted with short scenarios that you may have already experienced in your
    day-to-day work as a manager. We ask you to answer the following questions as intuitively and honestly as possible, even
    if the scenarios may seem hypothetical.<br><br>

    Please answer the questions from your standpoint as a manager, taking your own work experience into consideration.<br><br>

    The following scenarios include so-called <b>people analytics systems</b>. These are algorithm-driven systems that continuously
    collect and analyse data on productivity or the behaviour of employees in the workplace. The systemsâ€™ analyses and
    recommendations are made available to managers.

    Once again, thank you very much for your support!<br><br>
